# VISUALIZING FILTERS OF A CNN USING TENSORFLOW
THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON USING A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK. I USED A POPULAR VGG16 MODEL TO VISUALIZE VARIOUS FILTERS FROM DIFFERENT LAYERS OF THE CNN. IT WAS CONDUCTED BY USING GRADIENT ASCENT TO VISUALIZE IMAGES THAT MAXIMALLY ACTIVATE SPECIFIC FILTERS FROM DIFFERENT LAYERS OF THE MODEL. TENSORFLOW WAS THE MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORK.
